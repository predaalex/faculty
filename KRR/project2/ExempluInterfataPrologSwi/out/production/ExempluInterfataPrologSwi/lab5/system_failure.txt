Rules:
-If gt(cpu_temperature, 85) then has(overheating).
-If has(overheating) and has(fan_failure) then has(thermal_shutdown).
-If ge(hours_used, 8) and has(thermal_shutdown) then has(system_instability).
-If has(system_instability) and has(data_corruption) then has(system_failure).

Questions:
-[cpu_temperature] What is the CPU temperature (in Celsius)? (number)
-[hours_used] For how many hours has the system been running continuously? (number)
-[fan_failure] Is the cooling fan failing? (boolean)
-[data_corruption] Is there data corruption detected? (boolean)

The goal:
-has(system_failure).
